| Method Overloading      | Method Overriding     |
| :-------------   | :------------- |
| Method overloading is a compile time polymorphism.         | Method overriding is a run time polymorphism.       |
| It help to rise the readability of the program. | While it is used to grant the specific implementation of the method which is already provided by its parent class or super class. |
| It is occur within the class.	 | 	While it is performed in two classes with inheritance relationship. |
| Method overloading may or may not require inheritance. | While method overriding always needs inheritance. |
| In this, methods must have same name and different signature. | While in this, methods must have same name and same signature. |
| In method overloading, return type can or can not be be same, but we must have to change the parameter. | While in this, return type must be same or co-variant. |
