### 1. Object-Oriented

- **What is an Object?**

  An object is an instance of a class that has states and behaviors. A Class
  can be defined as a template that describes the behavior/state that the object
  of its type support.

<br>

- **What is the main feature of OOP ?**

    `Encapsulation`, `Polymorphism`, `Inheritance`, `Abstraction`

<br>

- **What is encapsulation?**

  Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. It is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as *data hiding*. To achieve encapsulation in Java:
    - Declare the variables of a class as private.
    - Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

  Benefits of Encapsulation:
    - The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
    - A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.

<br>

- **What is the difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?**

  Even though both Abstraction and Encapsulation looks similar because both hide complexity and make the external interface simpler there is a subtle difference between them. Abstraction hides logical complexity while Encapsulation hides Physical Complexity.

  | Abstraction     | Encapsulation     |
  | :------------- | :------------- |
  | Abstraction solves the problems in the design level       | Encapsulation solves the problems in the implementation level       |
  | Abstraction is used for hiding the unwanted data and giving relevant data | Encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit to protect the data from outside of the world |
  | Abstraction let you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it | Encapsulation means hiding the internal details mechanisms of how an objects does something |
  | Outer layout, used in terms of design: <br> Outer look of mobile phone, like it has display screen and keypad buttons to a number  | Inner layout, used in terms of implementation: <br> For example: Inner implementations detail of a mobile phone, how keypad button and display screen are connect with each other using circuits. |

<br>

- **Difference between abstract and interface?**

  | Interface     | Abstract class     |
  | :------------- | :------------- |
  | Support multiple inheritances | Does not support multiple inheritances |
  | Can extends another interfaces only | Can extends another class and implement multiple interfaces |
  | Does not contain data member | Contains data member |
  | Does not contains constructors | contains constructors  |
  | In Java Contains only incomplete member (signature of member) | Contains both signature (abstract) of method and member functions |
  | Cannot have access modifiers by default and everything is assumed as public | Can has access modifiers for subs, methods and fields |


- **What is Polymorphism?**

  The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: compile-time and runtime polymorphism.

- **What is the difference between static and dynamic Polymorphism?**

  *method overloading* represents a *static* form of polymorphism. method overloading means using two or more functions with same name but with the different parameters. Static polymorphism is resolved on compile-time and that is why it's called static. An example of this would be as follow:

  ```java
    class StaticPolymorphismTest {

      public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
      }

      public double multiply(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
      }

    }
  ```

  *method overriding* represents a *dynamic* form of polymorphism. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. It is also known as *Dynamic Method Dispatch*. dynamic polymorphism is resolved at runtime. An example of this would be as follow:

  ```java
  class Parent {

    void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("parent class");
    }
  }

  class subclass1 extends Parent {

    void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("subclass1");
    }
  }

  class subclass2 extends Parent {

    void Print()
    {
        System.out.println("subclass2");
    }
  }

  class TestPolymorphism3 {

    public static void main(String[] args){

        Parent a;

        a = new subclass1();
        a.Print();

        a = new subclass2();
        a.Print();
    }
  }
  ```

  Output:
  ```
  subclass1
  subclass2
  ```

- **Can Interfaces to be extended?**

  Yes, an interface can extend other interfaces. it supports multiple
  inheritances, which means it can extend more than one interface. But every
  class which wants to use an interface must add it by keyword `implements`
  and using the keyword `extends` for interfaces in classes is illegal and
  cause compile error.

- **What is the difference between overriding and overloading?**

  | Method Overloading      | Method Overriding     |
  | :-------------   | :------------- |
  | Method overloading is a compile time polymorphism.         | Method overriding is a run time polymorphism.       |
  | It help to rise the readability of the program. | While it is used to grant the specific implementation of the method which is already provided by its parent class or super class. |
  | It is occur within the class.	 | 	While it is performed in two classes with inheritance relationship. |
  | Method overloading may or may not require inheritance. | While method overriding always needs inheritance. |
  | In this, methods must have same name and different signature. | While in this, methods must have same name and same signature. |
  | In method overloading, return type can or can not be be same, but we must have to change the parameter. | While in this, return type must be same or co-variant. |

### 2. JAVA

- **How to prevent a class to be extended?**

- **What is the use of the finalize method?**
- **Overriding for static method, possible?**
- **What is an abstract class? Benefits?**
- **What is an object cloning? Is it enable for all objects?**
- **Multiple inheritances? Possible? How can we do that?**
- **Object scopes?**
- **Override private methods, possible?**
- **why access to the non-static variable is not allowed from static method in Java?**

  because non-static variable are associated with a specific instance of an object while static is not associated with any instance.

- **What is a static variable in Java?**
- **Java reference types?**
- **What is Generic in Java?**
- **How String class is implemented? Is it mutable or immutable? Why was it made immutable?**
- **What is the difference between int and Integer?**
- **What are Autoboxing and unboxing?**
- **What is the difference between initialization and instantiation?**
- **How does a static block work?**
- **What does the keyword `synchronized` mean?**

- **What is the `volatile` modifier?**
- **What is the `hashCode()` used for?**
- **What are "annotations"?**
- **When we use thread-safe , what does it mean?**
- **what is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?**

  Keyword `throw` is used to explicitly throw as an exception in the body of function, while `throws` is utilized to handle checked exceptions for re-intimating the compiler that exceptions are being handled. The throws need to be used in the function’s signature and also while invoking the method that raises checked exceptions.

### 4. Android

- **What is `Application` class?**

- **Difference between `Activity` and `Service`?**
- **Why do android apps need to ask permission like `INTERNET` or `LOCATION`?**
- **Differences between `serializable` and `Parcalable`?**
- **Why `serializable` body is empty? How is it doing?**
- **Which method in `fragment` runs only once?**
- **How does the activity respond when orientation is changed?**
- **How to know `configChange` happens in `onDestroy()` function?**
- **How to prevent the data from reloading when orientation is changed?**

  The most basic approach would be to use a combination of `ViewModels` and `onSaveInstanceState()`. A `ViewModel` is LifeCycle-Aware. In other words,
  a `ViewModel` will not be destroyed if its owner is destroyed for a
  configuration change (e.g. rotation). The new instance of the owner will
  just re-connected to the existing `ViewModel`. So if you rotate an `Activity`
  three times, you have just created three different `Activity` instances, but
  you only have one `ViewModel`. So the common practice is to store data in the
  `ViewModel` class (since it persists data during configuration changes) and
  use `OnSaveInstanceState()` to store small amounts of UI data.

- **How to handle multiple screen sizes?**
- **What is the difference between margin and padding?**

   - **Padding** will be space added inside the container, for instance,
    if it is a button, padding will be added inside the button.       

  - **Margin** will be space added outside the container.

- **What is `sw` keyword in `layout-sw600` folder meaning?**
- **What is the difference between `sw` and `w` and `h` as postfix in order to define the resources folder?**
- **What are the major differences between `ListView` and `RecyclerView`?**
  - **ViewHolder Pattern**: `Recyclerview` implements the ViewHolders pattern
    whereas it is not mandatory in a ListView. A `ViewHolder` object stores
    each of the component views inside the tag field of the Layout, so you can
    immediately access them without the need to look them up repeatedly.
    In `ListView`, the code might call `findViewById()` frequently during the
    scrolling of `ListView`, which can slow down performance. Even when the
    `Adapter` returns an inflated view for recycling, you still need to look up
    the elements and update them. A way around repeated use of `findViewById()`
     is to use the "view holder" design pattern.

  - **LayoutManager**: In a `ListView`, the only type of view available is
    the `vertical` ListView. A `RecyclerView` decouples list from its container
    so we can put list items easily at run time in the different containers
    (linearLayout, gridLayout) by setting LayoutManager.

  - **Item Animator**: `ListViews` are lacking in support of good animations,
    but the `RecyclerView` brings a whole new dimension to it.

- **Difference between `Intent` and `IntentService`?**
  - `Service` is the base class for Android services that can be extended to
    create any service. A class that directly extends `Service` runs on the main
    thread so it will block the UI (if there is one) and should therefore either
    be used only for short tasks or should make use of other threads for longer
    tasks.

  - `IntentService` is a subclass of `Service` that handles asynchronous requests
   (expressed as `Intents`) on demand. Clients send requests through
   `startService(Intent)` calls. The service is started as needed, handles each
   `Intent` in turn using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of
   work. [Read More on Mindorks's blog]("https://blog.mindorks.com/service-vs-intentservice-in-android")

- **How to pass items to `fragment`?**
- **What is `Fragment`?**
- **How would you communicate between two `fragments`?**
- **Difference between adding/replacing `fragment` in `backstack`?**
  - `replace` removes the existing `fragment` and adds a new `fragment`.
    This means when you press back button the fragment that got replaced will
    be created with its onCreateView being invoked.

  - `add` retains the existing fragments and adds a new `fragment` that means
    existing fragment  will be active and they wont be in 'paused' state hence
    when a back button is pressed onCreateView is not called for the existing
    fragment(the fragment which was there before new fragment was added).

    In terms of fragment’s life cycle events `onPause()`, `onResume()`,
    `onCreateView()` and other life cycle events will be invoked in case of
    `replace` but they wont be invoked in case of `add`.

- **What is the difference between `dialog` and `dialogFragment`?**

- **What is the difference between `Thread` and `AsyncTask`?**

- **What is the relationship between the life cycle of an `AsyncTask` and an `Activity`? What problems can this result in? How can these problems be avoided?**

  An AsyncTask is not tied to the life cycle of the Activity that contains it.
  So, for example, if you start an AsyncTask inside an Activity and the user
  rotates the device, the Activity will be destroyed (and a new Activity
  instance will be created) but the AsyncTask will not die but instead goes
  on living until it completes.

  Then, when the AsyncTask does complete, rather than updating the UI of the
  new Activity, it updates the former instance of the Activity (i.e., the one
  in which it was created but that is not displayed anymore!). This can lead to
  an Exception (of the type java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: View not attached
  to window manager if you use, for instance, findViewById to retrieve a view
  inside the Activity).

  There’s also the potential for this to result in a memory leak since the
  AsyncTask maintains a reference to the Activity, which prevents the Activity
  from being garbage collected as long as the AsyncTask remains alive.

  For these reasons, using AsyncTasks for long-running background tasks is
  generally a bad idea . Rather, for long-running background tasks, a different
  mechanism (such as a service) should be employed.

- **What is `Lopper` and how it works?**
- **What are Handlers?**

    Handlers are objects for managing threads. It receives messages and writes
    code on how to handle the message. They run outside of the activity’s
    lifecycle, so they need to be cleaned up properly or else you will have
    thread leaks. Handlers allow communicating between the background thread
    and the main thread.

- **What is the difference between `Foreground` and `Background` and `Bounded` service?**
  - __Foreground Service:__ A foreground `service` performs some operation that
  is noticeable to the user. For example, we can use a foreground service to
  play an audio track. A `Notification` must be displayed to the user.

  - __Background Service:__ A background `service` performs an operation that
  isn’t directly noticed by the user. In Android API level 26 and above, there
  are restrictions to using background services and it is recommended to use
  WorkManager in these cases

  - __Bound Service:__ A `service` is bound when an application component binds
  to it by calling `bindService()`. A bound service offers a client-server
  interface that allows components to interact with the `service`, send requests,
  receive results. A bound service runs only as long as another application
  component is bound to it. [Read More](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services)

- **What are the limitations of using `Services` in android 8 and higher?**
- **What is `JobScheduling`?**
- **What is `contentProvider` and what is typically used for?**

  A `ContentProvider` provides data from one application to another, when
  requested. It manages access to a structured set of data. It provides mechanisms for defining data security. [Learn more]("https://medium.com/@sanjeevy133/an-idiots-guide-to-android-content-providers-part-1-970cba5d7b42" "An idiot guide to android content providers").
  For further reading see the [official android documentation]("https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics" "Android official documentation")

- **What is the difference between `apply()` and `commit()` in `sharedPreferences`?**
  - `commit()` writes the data **synchronously** and returns a boolean value of
    success or failure depending on the result immediately.

  - `apply()` is **asynchronous** and it won’t return any boolean response. Also
    if there is an `apply()` outstanding and we perform another `commit()`,
    The `commit()` will be blocked until the `apply()` is not completed.

- **How you load your `Bitmaps`? What do you do for loading large bitmaps?**
[Loading Large Bitmaps Efficiently in Android](https://android.jlelse.eu/loading-large-bitmaps-efficiently-in-android-66826cd4ad53 "Loading Large Bitmaps Efficiently in Android")

- **How Android apps compiled and run?**
  1. First step involves compiling the resources folder (/res) using the aapt
    (android asset packaging tool) tool. These are compiled to a single class
    file called R.java. This is a class that just contains constants.

  2. Second step involves the java source code being compiled to .class files
    by javac, and then the class files are converted to Dalvik bytecode by the
    “dx” tool, which is included in the sdk ‘tools’. The output is classes.dex.

  3. The final step involves the android apkbuilder which takes all the input
    and builds the apk (android packaging key) file.

### 7. Gradle

- **What is buildType?**

- **What do you do if you want to publish different versions of an APK with the same codabase?**

    *using product flavor.* [What is flavor?]("https://android.jlelse.eu/product-flavors-for-android-library-d3b2d240fca2")

- **How to add a dependency only on a certain build of the app?**

  Flavor dependency. What? don't worry, [read this link]("https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies#dependency-configurations")

- **What is the difference between `implementation` and `api`?**

  These two keywords work the same when you want to add a new library but the main difference occurs when using it in the internal library. Let's explain it with an example. Consider your app has a library called 'libraryA'. This library is also dependant on another library called 'libraryB'. the dependency flow will be : `app -> libraryA -> libraryB` . If the libraryB is declared in libraryA with keyword `implementation`, so your app module does not know anything about the classes of libraryB. So you can't access and use any classes of libraryB. If you want to do that, you must declare libraryB in the libraryA Gradle file with keyword `api`. For more information read [this medium link]("https://medium.com/mindorks/implementation-vs-api-in-gradle-3-0-494c817a6fa").


- **What do you mean by Gradle wrapper?**

  The Gradle wrapper is the most suitable way to initiate a Gradle build. A Gradle wrapper is a Window’s batch script which has a shell script for the OS (operating system). Once you start the Gradle build via the wrapper, you will see an auto download which runs the build.

<br>

### 8. Design patterns

According to a report by [codespaghetti]("http://www.codespaghetti.com/java-design-pattern-interview-questions/"), The most design patterns that you must to know are **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Builder**. I didn't bring the typical questions like what is a singleton, factory, and... . I imagine you fluent on these patterns and instead, I will focus on the other side of questions that may asked in the interview meeting.

![Top 5 java design pattern interview questions](/assets/images/design-patterns-report.png)

- **When to use Adapter pattern? (Not for RecyclerView or ListView)**

  Use Adapter pattern when you need to make two class work with incompatible interfaces. Adapter pattern can also be used to encapsulate third party code so that your application only depends upon Adapter, which can adapt itself when third party code changes or you moved to a different third party library.

- **In singleton pattern whether it is better to make the whole `getInstance()` method synchronized or just critical section is enough? Which one is preferable?**

  Synchronization of whole `getInstance()` method is costly and is only needed during the initialization on singleton instance, to stop creating another instance of Singleton.  Therefore it is better to only synchronize critical section and not the whole method.

- **How many ways can you write singleton class in Java?**

  One can write singleton class in Java in five ways

    - Classic Java Singleton pattern
    ```java
    Public class Singleton{

        private static Singleton instance;

        private Singleton(){          
        }

        public static Singleton getInstance(){
          if(instance == null)
            instance = new Singleton();
          return instance;
        }

    }

    ```

    - A thread-safe singleton pattern in java using Synchronization

    ```java
    public class Singleton{

        private static final Singleton instance = null;

        private Singleton(){}

        public synchronized static Singleton getInstance(){
            if(instance == null)
                instance = new Singleton();

            return instance;
        }
    }
    ```

    - Double-checked locking with volatile keyword

    ```java
    public class Singleton {

        private volatile static Singleton instance;

        private Singleton (){}

        public static Singleton getSingleton() {          
          if (instance == null) {                                     
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {              
                if (instance == null)                    
                    instance = new Singleton();                                    
                }            
          }          
          return instance;        
        }

    }    
    ```

    - Initialization-on-demand with singleton holder

    ```java
    // Correct lazy initialization in Java
    @ThreadSafe
    class Singleton {

        private Singleton() {}

        private static class SingletonHolder {
            public static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
        }

        public static Singleton getInstance() {
            return SingletonHolder.instance;
        }
    }
    ```

    - Using Enum

    ```java
    enum Color {

        RED(1), GREEN(2), YELLOW(3);

        private int nCode ;

        private Color( int _nCode) {
          this.nCode = _nCode;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
          return String.valueOf ( this . nCode );
        }

    }

    public class ColorTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Color red = Color.RED;
            Color red2 = Color.RED;

            System.out.println(red == red2); // return true
        }
    }
    ```
<br>
- **What are the drawbacks of using singleton design pattern?**

  - **Testability issue:** The bad thing with singletons is that the
  `getInstance()` method is globally accessible. That means that you usually
  call it from within a class, instead of depending on an interface you can
  later mock. That's why it's impossible to replace it when you want to test
  the method or the class.

  - **Tight Coupling:** The singleton object is exposed globally and is
  available to a whole application. Thus, classes using this object become
  tightly coupled. So any change in the global object will impact all other
  classes using it.

  - **Violation issues:** Singleton principle can be violated by techniques such
  as cloning. If an application is running on multiple JVM’s, then, in this case,
  Singleton might be broken.

- **How can you prevent creating another instance of singleton using `clone()` method?**

  The preferred way to prevent creating another instance of a singleton is by not implementing Cloneable interface and if you do just throw an exception from `clone()` method "_not to create a clone of singleton class_".

- **When will you prefer to use a Factory Pattern?**

  The factory pattern is preferred in the following cases:
    - A class does not know which class of objects it must create

    - Factory pattern can be used where we need to create an object of any one of sub-classes depending on the data provided

    - you can use factory pattern where you have to create an object of any one of sub-classes depending on the given data


- **Why use a factory class to instantiate a class when we can use new operator?**

  Factory classes provide flexibility in terms of design. Below are some of the
  benefits of factory class:

    - Factory design pattern results in more decoupled code as it allows us to
      hide creational logic from dependent code
    - It allows us to introduce an [Inversion of Control]("https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/592372/Dependency-Injection-DI-vs-Inversion-of-Control-IO" "What is IoC?") container
    - It gives you a lot more flexibility when it comes time to change the
      application as our creational logic is hidden from dependant code

- **What is the difference between factory and abstract factory design pattern?**

  Both factory and abstract factory are creational design patterns. The major
  difference between these two is, a factory pattern creates an object through
  inheritance and produces only one Product. On the other hand, an abstract
  factory pattern creates the object through composition and produce families
  of products. In other word an abstract factory is "factory of factories". You can find an example [___here___]("https://www.journaldev.com/1418/abstract-factory-design-pattern-in-java").

- **(My Favorite question!) Suppose we are building an application for a pizza
store and we need to model their pizza classes. Assume they offer four types
of pizzas namely Peppy Paneer, Farmhouse, Margherita and Chicken Fiesta. Each
pizza has a different cost. We have overridden the getCost() in the subclasses
to find the appropriate cost. Now let's become it more interesting! suppose a
new requirement, in addition to a pizza, customer can also ask for several
toppings such as Fresh Tomato, Paneer, Jalapeno, Capsicum, Barbeque, etc.
Toppings may be redundant and it's OK. (It means a customer may choose double
jalapeno or three-time barbeque). Each topping has its price and by adding
each one the total cost of the pizza will be increased. If you have to suggest
only one design pattern to solve this problem, choose which one? why? and
How you implement it?**

- **If you couldn't find a solution to the previous question, don't worry and
follow this one. It can help you to find out how to solve it. The question is,
Which design pattern allows you to implement the inheritance approach at the
runtime?**

- **which pattern is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation?**

  When we want to decouple an abstraction from its implementation in order that two can vary independently we use **bridge pattern**.
